# Freeze

Freeze is an immutable data structure library for Roblox Luau.

Be sure to read the [documentation](https://ahmoin.github.io/Freeze/)!

Immutable data structures are imperative for use with popular libraries such as
React and Rodux. To learn more about why immutability is important, check out
our
[How does immutability help?](https://ahmoin.github.io/Freeze/docs/WhyImmutable)
page.

Freeze is typed and currently used in several ahmoin projects.

Use Freeze to create immutable data structures like so:

```lua
local map1 = { a = 1, b = 2, c = 3 }
local map2 = Freeze.Dictionary.set(map1, "b", 50)

print(map1.b, "vs", map2.b)
-- 2 vs 50
```

Freeze will optimize return calls in such that it will return the original list
or dictionary if no changes were made:

```lua
local map1 = { a = 1 }
local map2 = Freeze.Dictionary.set(map1, "a", 1)

print(map1 == map2)
-- true; because no changes were made
```

True to it's name, Freeze will return calls of new values wrapped in
`table.frozen`. Return values that are not changed will not be `table.frozen`'d
to preserve the caller's frozen status.

## Nested Data Structures

Freeze also has a few power tools at your disposal to allow for reading and
operating on nested data structures. These include
[`getIn`](/api/Dictionary#getIn), [`setIn`](/api/Dictionary#setIn),
[`mergeIn`](/api/Dictionary#mergeIn), and
[`updateIn`](/api/Dictionary#updateIn), found on
[`Dictionary`](/api/Dictionary).

## Freeze's General Philosophy

Freeze aims to

- Be type safe. Types are represented in such that there are no false negative
  type errors.
- Be runtime safe. Errors will not propagate unless you are passing invalid
  values that the Luau type checker would have caught.
- Enforce immutability via `table.frozen`
- Optimize return values if no changes were made within the operation by
  returning the original value.

## Prior art

Freeze takes inspiration from:

- [Llama by freddylist](https://github.com/freddylist/llama)
- [Immutable.js](https://immutable-js.com/)
